    <h2>This delicious Salami pizza is a great easy recipe that everyone will love.</h2>
    <p>Itâ€™s topped with Italian salami, banana peppers, red onion, and lots of cheese and is a definite winner!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>pizza dough</li>
        <li>marinara sauce</li>
        <li>shredded mozzarella cheese and fresh mozzarella pearls</li>
        <li>freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Italian salami</li>
        <li>red onion</li>
        <li>peppers</li>
        <li>fresh basil or fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit, or an as hot as it will go. Place a pizza stone in the oven to let the stone heat.  Prepare the pizza dough, whether homemade or from the store, so it is raised, and ready to roll out into a pizza.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a pizza paddle (you can use metal or wooden) lightly with corn meal, and roll out the pizza dough into a large circle about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick (depending on your preferences).</li>
        <li>Spread the prepared pizza sauce over the top of the crust. Then evenly sprinkle it with mozzarella cheese. Add salami slices evenly over the cheese.</li>
        <li>Then spread peppers and red onion over the top of the salami if desired. Sprinkle grated parmigiano and fresh mozzarella balls over the top.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the pizza to the pizza stone and bake for 10-14 minutes, or until the cheese is evenly melted. (You can also bake it in a pizza oven until golden, we love ours)</li>
        <li>Garnish the pizza with parmesan, and fresh parsley or basil, and slice it up and enjoy hot.</li>
    </ol>
